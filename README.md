This repository provides for an information system meant to help encourage renewable energy in the country.

This would be achieved by integrating smart monitoring systems to measure power consumption realtime. At the same time private off-grid have the opportunity to integrate with the grid to effectively 'sell' the excess power they generate to the grid with the power distributor providing monitory compensation for the service.

Affectionately, the system reduces cost of renewable energy adoption as with a grid tie system you can receive power from the grid when self generation is low.
